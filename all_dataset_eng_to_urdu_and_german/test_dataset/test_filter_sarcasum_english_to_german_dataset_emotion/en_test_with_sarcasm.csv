"emoticonxwow archie, i realize the following will be wasted on you, but i'll say it anyways.... there is a huge difference inbetween a 'spiritual' issue... and a demonic one... the fact that christians look at 'homosexuality' as a spiritual issue is one thing. blaming it on demons and invoking an exorcism is quite another. and thus, archie places himself firmly in the 'exorcism' camp... i am not surprised... archie, there are a lot of christian reparative therapy groups out there. by and large, they don't work with 'exorcisms'. do you think they should be working with 'exorcisms' to rid people of homosexuality???",Not Hope,Sarcasm

" barbaric) than what Hitler did in the Holocaust?"" So once again we have a viewpoint that misses the fact that the vast majority of those exterminated by the Nazi's died under extremely unpleasant conscious circumstances? there was no mercy lost on these people, and many had been subjected to early traumas and tortures as well.How can you even compare being gassed (large chamber or small?), shot, beaten to death maybe even being killed in an experiement to test the limits of human resistance to high atmospheric pressure with aborting a foetus?Or perhaps you would care to demonstrate how a foetus that is aborted experiences any terror and pain like someone who was gassed at Auschwitz?THe crux of this is can you prove that an abortion is more barbaric than torture and death of a conscious person.
